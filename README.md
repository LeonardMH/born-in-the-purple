A simple theme for oh-my-zsh with a slight purple motif.

## Install

Copy the theme to your oh-my-zsh custom themes directory:

```bash
cp bitp.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes
```

Then set the theme in your `~/.zshrc`

```bash
ZSH_THEME="bitp"
```

## Information

Screenshot captured on macOS, using iTerm 2 with an Atom One style theme:
- [joshdick/onedark.vim/term](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim/tree/main/term)

I then use Atom One Dark styled themes for all of my applications that support it:
- Vim, [joshdick/onedark.vim](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim)
- Emacs, [doom-one](https://github.com/doomemacs/themes)
